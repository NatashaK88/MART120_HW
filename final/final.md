day 1- making a proposal and loosely making a plan

day 2 find pictures for circles through the use of an AI image generator called Copilot. I redid every search several times to get 3-5 ideas for each of the 16 themes. 

day 3. Using Photoshop I edited the pictures erased things I didn’t and combined pictures if needed. I made a circular template for the front and back to easily do all 16 pictures. 

day 4. continues working on the circles adding info to the back.

day 5. set up a basic HTML website and searched the 5js library to find a rotating circle. after the 3d circles 
did not work because they did not rotate properly. after finding one I liked  I added the CDN. Then I added
all 32 pictures and I couldn’t get them to line up right so I had to redo it and change it to what it is now, After that I added in the css and JavaScript. I messed with the lines a little and tried to get help from chat GPT but I couldn’t make them connect to the circles and make them movable as I had envisioned. 

day 6. I added wording to each side of the circles to explain what’s going on and changed the background color to a light blue and finished typing this and making my .md page. Since I have a couple more days I’m going to continue to look for a solution for making the rest of my vision possible.
